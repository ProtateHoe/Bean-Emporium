      <p>I have been a bean man for years, in my heart of heart maybe forever. As a child it was baked beans (on toast/with a fry up). If beans were on the menu, Nic was at the table.
        At Uni i developed a strong dependence on jacket potatoes with cheese and beans for general survival. However as I have grown older, my love for beans has developed into a more refined appreciation
        as my discovery of Mexican food developed my love and knowledge of beans also developed alongside. In this page you will find out how this has affected my life, and hopefully find how it can affect your own</p>

        <h4>The OG</h4>
        <p>The kidney bean is possibly the most common of all beans. It is robust, versatile and kinda yucky on its own. However you combine this lumb of protein with a little love and care...
          and wow, you've unlocked a whole new world of devine flavour. Not only that but it can be used to add body to a dish, the neccesary oomph to make a meal truly fulfilling. The versatility
          of this lil beany boy means that you have almost infinite options as to preperation techniques or flavour parings.</p>

        <h4>The Deciever</h4>
        <p>This is a cashew nut... which while looking like a very dry bean, is in fact not a bean at all. It is actually a nut. Not many people know this which has caused an endless amount of
        domestic arguments as one member of the family may attempt to put cashews into the three bean salad being prepared for dinner. Only to be <em>rightfully</em> repremanded for their fooolish actions.</p>
