  <p>I have been a bean man for years, in my heart of heart maybe forever. As a child it was baked beans <em>on toast, with a fry up</em> if beans were on the menu, Nic was at the table.
    At Uni i developed a strong dependence on jacket potatoes with cheese and beans for general survival. However as I have grown older, my love for beans has developed into a more refined appreciation
    as my discovery of Mexican food developed my love and knowledge of beans also developed alongside. In this page you will find out how this has affected my life, and hopefully find how it can affect your own</p>
